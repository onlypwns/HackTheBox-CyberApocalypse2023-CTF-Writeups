we can register a user and see where does that take us

we visit the /register directory

Ok, now with the registered user we can see what is going on the server

There is a JWT lets see if we can manipulate that and access the /admin panel that is restricted

### From burp i loaded an extension that gets us to work with attacking JWT , we send a GET request to the /admin directory and modify the JWT with the none algorithm attack, and setting the id to 1

### Sending the request give us access to the admin dashboard

Not much to see from the admin dashboard so lets see if we can find another way to get access to the flag

Going back to reviewing the files for the challenge we notice an interesting thing, as from below the username is being rendered with a js template, looks like SSTI so let’s try to craft a payload and see if it can work!

Found this one from HackTricks let’s see if it can work when we register a new user!

Looks like our command got through successfully!

### Payload used:

```powershell
"{{:\"pwnd\".toString.constructor.call({},\"return global.process.mainModule.constructor._load('child_process').execSync('cat /etc/passwd').toString()\") ()}}"
```

If we call back to the /admin we get the content of the /flag.txt in the response
